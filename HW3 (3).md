# CSDS 133 Written Homework 3
**Instructions:** Each question is worth 10 points unless otherwise stated. Write your answers below the question. Only one answer is needed from a group unless otherwise specified. Each answer should be formatted so it renders properly on github. **Answers that do not render properly may not be graded.** Each person in each group must commit and push their own work. You will not get credit for work committed/pushed by someone else even if done by you. Each person is expected to do an approximately equal share of the work, as shown by the git logs. **If we do not see evidence of equal contribution from the logs for someone, their individual grade will be reduced substantially.** Please comment the last commit with "FINAL COMMIT" and **enter the final commit ID in canvas by the due date.**

Note: Questions which ask you to "prove" something often require a general argument rather than specific examples. For other questions, please show your work rather than just the final answer for full credit.

1. Find $f \circ g$ and $g \circ f$ for $f(x)=\sqrt{(x+2)}$ and $g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$.

Answer:

2. Using the definition of the derivative, show that $\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{x}=\frac{-1}{x^2}$. 

Answer:


3. Prove the quotient rule using the product rule and the chain rule of derivatives. You can use the result from Q2 above.

Answer: 

4. Find the derivative of $f(x)=a^x$ where $a$ is a constant. Show your work. (Hint: Write $f(x)$ as an exponential function and use the chain rule.)

Answer: 

5.  Find the Jacobian of $f(x,y)=\[x^y, y^x, e^{xy}\]$. Show your work. (Hint: The derivative of $x^n$, $n$ constant, is $nx^{n-1}$.)

Answer: 

6. Let $f(x, y, z)=(x^2+z, x+y^2)$. Let $g(a, b)=(a^3b^2, a^2b^3, a^2âˆ’b^3)$. Find the Jacobian of $f \circ g$. Show your work.

Answer: 

7. Find the Hessian of $f \circ g$ from Q6. Show your work.

Answer: 

8. Prof. Calculus is climbing Mt. Steepy McSteepface. At each point $(x,y)$ the mountain has height $h(x,y)= 100e^{-(x^2+y^2-6x-8y+25)}$. Help Prof. Calculus by finding the height of the summit. Show your work.

Answer:

9. When Prof. Calculus reaches the point on the mountain with $(x,y)$ coordinates of $(2, 2)$ in Q8 they feel an urgent need to return to the base camp which is at $(0,0)$. Find the best direction they should start to move in at this point to return quickly to camp. 

Answer:

10. Show that the set $C=\\{x : Ax \geq b\\}$ , with $A$ a matrix of size $(m,n)$, $x$ a vector of size $n$, $b$ a vector of size $m$, is a convex set. 

Answer:

11. Suppose $S=\\{x : \Vert x\Vert \leq 1\\}$ where $x$ are vectors of size $n$. Show that $S$ is a convex set.

Answer: 

12. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two arbitrary convex functions. Prove or give a counterexample: (i) $f+g$ is convex (ii) $f-g$ is convex.
